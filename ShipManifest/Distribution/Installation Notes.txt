Thanks for downloading Ship Manifest!

Ship Manifest is a tool to manage your ship's "things".  I started with [url=http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60936]Crew Manifest[/url] as a basis for this work, with great thanks to vXSovereignXv for creating Crew Manifest, and Sarbian for contributions to Crew Manifest.  

I've now re-imagined it into Ship Manifest, using the same easy to navigate system that vXSovereignXv used.  Many changes and refactoring have occurred, so SM no longer resembles Crew Manifest in use or "under the hood". Even the original crew transfers have been greatly modified.

 - Kottabos did a fine review here:  [url]www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_TNxjnW234[/url] (Feb 28th). It was very educational for me :).  I've long since fixed the bugs and added so much more... :D

This work was originally based on Crew manifest 0.5.6.0 by xxSovereignxx as modified by Sarbian to work with 0.22.
